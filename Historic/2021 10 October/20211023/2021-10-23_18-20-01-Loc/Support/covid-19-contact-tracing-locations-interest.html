<h2 class="h6" style="margin-top: 0px;">What to do if you have been at a location listed below</h2>

<p>Please see the locations of interest in the table and on the map below. If you visited a location of interest during the relevant time, follow the health instructions provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If required, call Healthline on <a href="tel:08003585453">0800 358 5453</a>&nbsp;or you can <a href="https://tracing.covid19.govt.nz/loi">record your visit online</a>. If you record your visit online, you do not need to call Healthline &ndash; our contact tracers will call or email you.</p>

<p>If you are required to isolate you must do so until you have spoken to Healthline. They will advise you and your household members on what you need to do.</p>

<p>However, if you are a casual contact who has been at a location of interest, you do not need to record your visit online or by phoning Healthline.</p>

<p>Please note that there are <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-response-planning/covid-19-epidemic-notice-and-orders#section70">section 70 public health orders</a> in place that require you to follow health orders. This also applies to household contacts for some locations (unless the contact is a vaccinated health worker or managed isolation and quarantine worker, and they meet certain criteria).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyone who returns a positive COVID-19 test is required to enter a managed isolation facility for 14 days.</p>

<p>If you have been contacted by a district health board, the Ministry of Health or a district health board public health unit, please follow their advice.</p>

<h2><a id="loitable" name="loitable"></a>Locations of interest</h2>

<p><strong>The table below contains all current locations of interest.</strong></p>

<p>You can filter results by location name or address (eg,&nbsp;city or suburb) using the search.</p>

<p>The most recently added or updated locations are listed first.&nbsp;Locations are removed from this list after 18 days.</p>

<p>This table is currently updated regularly throughout the day until&nbsp;6pm each day. If the number of locations interest significantly increases after that time, then the last publication time will be extended to 8pm.</p>

<p>In addition to the locations of interest below there are sometimes exposure events that do not involve the general public. In that case the affected people are contacted directly by contact tracers.</p>
